## [The issue of blank nodes in RDF](https://github.com/terminusdb/technical-blogs/blob/main/blogs/blank_nodes_in_rdf.md)
*Author:* Somethingelseentirely - *Discord community member*

*Date:* Friday, Jun 24, 2022

*Description:*
This article by TerminusDB community member Somethingelseentirely focuses on the issue of blank nodes in RDF. Blank nodes have long been an underrecognized problem in RDF with practitioners apparently comfortable with solving graph isomorphism on the fly over and over again. TerminusDB takes the approach of immediately skolemizing blank nodes to ensure that it never becomes an issue.
